🌐 AlphaSign: Flutter & CNN Gesture Classifier

![cnn](eye.jpg)

AlphaSign is an advanced AI-driven application designed to recognize and classify hand gestures corresponding to the alphabet. Built with a Flutter front end and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in Flask, this project aims to bridge the gap in accessible, real-time gesture recognition and empower those learning sign language.

📱 App Overview

AlphaSign leverages the power of AI and deep learning to classify hand gestures, providing real-time feedback on alphabet gestures. Its streamlined interface and intelligent backend make it ideal for users looking to learn and communicate with gestures.

App Features

Real-time Gesture Detection: Using CNN, AlphaSign identifies and classifies gestures into alphabet letters.
Responsive Design: A Flutter-based mobile interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
Seamless Backend: A Flask API serves as the bridge between the app and the CNN model.
Lightweight & Fast: Designed for optimal speed and usability.

🚀 Deployment

To deploy AlphaSign, follow these steps:

Frontend: The Flutter app is the user interface. It communicates with the Flask backend to retrieve predictions for hand gestures.
Backend: The CNN model is hosted on Flask, handling requests from the Flutter app, processing images, and returning predictions in real-time.
Hosting: Both the Flutter app and Flask API can be deployed locally or hosted on platforms like Heroku, Firebase, or Google Cloud.
